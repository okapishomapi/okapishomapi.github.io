## Course description

Big data is sexy right now. SQL is like the hipster of data. It was cool before people were into data. Most large companies, and many small ones, store all the valuable information about their companies in databases, and SQL is the language to get at that data and find out what you want about your customers, your products, and your entire business. SQL is a declarative language, which means it reads a lot like English, and is easy to get started with.

This class will teach you how to query databases, create them, and edit them, to get the information you need without waiting for developers or business analysts. SQL power to the people.
